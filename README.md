## Dependent third-party libraries

> **Qt**   
> https://www.qt.io/product


> <img src="Resources/Icons/logo-cuda.png" width="90" >

> **Nvidia Cuda** version (equal to or greater than) 11.0

>
> **VTK** version 
> https://vtk.org/    
> VTK now is only used for load mhd file volume data and display the rendering results

> Choose between two settings:
>
> VTK version 8 (equal to or greater than 8.2) with Qt 5 (equal to or greater than 5.5)      
> VTK 8.2 version starts supporting QVTKOpenGLNativeWidget     
> And VTK version 8 does not support Qt 6
>
>
> VTK version 9 (equal to or greater than 9.1) with Qt 6 (equal to or greater than 6.1)      
> VTK version 9 support Qt 6
>
>
> VTK needs to be co-compiled with Qt to generate QVTKOpenGLNativeWidget.
> 
> Our setting is VTK version 9.2.6 with Qt 6.2.4



## Corresponding CMake path that needs to be modified (in CMakeLists.txt)

> **Qt Dir**
> - set(Qt6_DIR "D:/DevTools/Qt6/6.2.4/msvc2019_64/" CACHE PATH "qt5 cmake dir") 

> **VTK Dir**

# <img src="Resources/Images/crystal.png" width="40" > Supported Features

## 3D medical images Cinematic rendering

> Utilize advanced visualization techniques to process medical image data, and apply physically-based rendering techniques to achieve realistic rendering effects.

## Advanced Visualization Tools

> Implement multiple visualization processing algorithms and enable interactive operation of said algorithms.

## Support for multiple light sources

> Provide support for multiple light sources, including point light, surface light, directional light, and high dynamic range environment mapping, to illuminate medical 3D data.

## Real time denoising

> Provide real-time denoising capabilities for realistic rendering, with the intention of achieving high-quality rendering results in interaction.
